The mod's features are as follows. Most features can be enabled/disabled individually in the mod's configuration.

[h3]Teleportation[/h3]
[list]
	[*][b]Return Tools[/b]: Adds an upgraded Magic Mirror and Cell Phone that include the return portal feature of the Potion of Return. This feature is also integrated into the vanilla Shellphone.
	[*][b]Teleport Item Scroll-Away[/b]: When you teleport using a potion, mirror, or phone, your hotbar will automatically scroll to its first item so you don't accidentally teleport again. (This feature is disabled by default since its behavior can be unintuitive.)
[/list]

[h3]Miscellaneous Items[/h3]
[list]
	[*][b]Button[/b]: A visually stateless alternative to the switch. Sold by the Mechanic.
	[*][b]Pink Banner[/b]: A pink variant of the decorative banner, so that there is now one for each team color. Crafted like the others.
[/list]
