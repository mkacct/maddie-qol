This is a minimal quality-of-life mod intended to unobtrusively add "completeness" to various aspects of the game, mostly regarding items and crafting. It is a strictly "Vanilla+" mod, only adding content that in my opinion ought to be present in the base game, with obtainment methods characteristic of the base game. Many crafting recipes are added, so use a mod such as Recipe Browser if you'd like to see them.

Check the Steam Workshop page for relevant links, including where to report bugs.

The mod consists of the following modules (many of which can be enabled/disabled individually in the mod's configuration).

Teleportation:
- Return Tools: Adds an upgraded Magic Mirror and phones that include the return portal feature of the Potion of Return.
- Teleport Item Scroll-Away: When you teleport using a potion, mirror, or phone, your hotbar will automatically scroll to its first item so you don't accidentally teleport again. (Disabled by default.)

Wiring and Devices:
- Signal Generator: A craftable tool you can use to activate wires by clicking on them.
- Button: A visually stateless alternative to the switch. Sold by the Mechanic.
- Music Box (Silence): Suppresses the game's music. Sold by the Wizard in a graveyard.

Vanilla Item Obtainability:
- Missing Furniture Recipes: Adds missing recipes for Dungeon and Obsidian furniture.
- Lihzahrd Item Renewability: Lihzahrd placeable items can be obtained by shopping from NPCs in the Jungle after defeating Golem.
- Dungeon Item Recipes: Additional Dungeon placeable items are craftable.
- Trap Recipes: All traps are craftable in a graveyard.
- Chest Recipes: All otherwise non-renewable chests are craftable.
- Vase Recipes: Dungeon and Obsidian Vases are craftable.
- Easier Title Music Boxes: All three title music boxes are obtainable through alternate methods that do not require combining large quantities of other music boxes.
- Dirt from Mud: Mud blocks can be crafted back into dirt blocks at a furnace.
- Default Familiar Set: All newly-created characters spawn with the Familiar set in their inventory. (Disabled by default.)
- Lihzahrd Door Lock: The Chest Lock also works on Lihzahrd Doors (after defeating Plantera).
- Encumbering Stone Recipe: The Encumbering Stone is craftable.
- Pwnhammer Recipe: The Pwnhammer is craftable from Hallowed Bars.
- Hellforge Recipe: The Hellforge is craftable, albeit requiring Hellstone Bars so as not to break progression.
