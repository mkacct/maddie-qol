This is a minimal quality-of-life mod intended to unobtrusively add "completeness" to various aspects of the game, mostly regarding items and crafting. It is a strictly "Vanilla+" mod, only adding content that in my opinion ought to be present in the base game, with obtainment methods characteristic of the base game. Many crafting recipes are added, so use a mod such as Recipe Browser if you'd like to see them.

This mod is not considered finished; more features will likely be added in the future.

Check the Steam Workshop page for relevant links, including where to report bugs.

The mod consists of the following modules (many of which can be enabled/disabled individually in the mod's configuration).

Teleportation:
- Return Tools: Adds an upgraded Magic Mirror and phones that include the return portal feature of the Potion of Return.
- Teleport Item Scroll-Away: When you teleport using a potion, mirror, or phone, your hotbar will automatically scroll to its first item so you don't accidentally teleport again. (Disabled by default)

Liquid Manipulation:
- Bottomless Multipurpose Bucket: A Tinkerer's Workshop combination of the Bottomless Buckets for the three mundane liquids (and another that includes Shimmer), switchable like the Shellphone.
