This is a quality-of-life mod intended to add "completeness" to various aspects of the game, mostly regarding items and crafting.

Check the Steam Workshop page for relevant links.

The mod's features are as follows. Most features can be enabled/disabled individually in the mod's configuration.

Teleportation:
- Return Tools: Adds an upgraded Magic Mirror and Cell Phone that include the return portal feature of the Potion of Return. This feature is also integrated into the vanilla Shellphone.
- Teleport Item Scroll-Away: When you teleport using a potion, mirror, or phone, your hotbar will automatically scroll to its first item so you don't accidentally teleport again. (This feature is disabled by default since its behavior can be unintuitive.)

Miscellaneous Items:
- Button: A visually stateless alternative to the switch. Sold by the Mechanic.

Vanilla Item Obtainability:
- Dungeon Item Renewability: Dungeon Bricks of all colors can be obtained by fishing.
- Lihzahrd Item Renewability: Lihzahrd Bricks and related items can be obtained by shopping from NPCs in the Jungle after defeating Golem.
- Missing Furniture Recipes: Adds missing recipes for Dungeon and Obsidian furniture.
- Trap Recipes: All traps are craftable in a graveyard.
- Chest Recipes: All otherwise non-renewable chests are craftable.
- Vase Recipes: Dungeon and Obsidian Vases are craftable.
- Easier Title Music Box Obtainability: All three title music boxes are obtainable through alternate methods that do not require combining large quantities of other music boxes.
- Encumbering Stone Recipe: The Encumbering Stone is craftable.
- Hellforge Recipe: The Hellforge is craftable, albeit requiring Hellstone Bars so as not to break progression.
