This is a minimal quality-of-life mod intended to unobtrusively add "completeness" to various aspects of the game, mostly regarding items and crafting. It is a strictly "Vanilla+" mod, only adding content that in my opinion ought to be present in the base game, with obtainment methods characteristic of the base game. Many crafting recipes are added, so use a mod such as Recipe Browser if you'd like to see them.

This mod is not considered finished; more features will likely be added in the future.

Check the Steam Workshop page for relevant links, including where to report bugs.

The mod consists of the following modules (many of which can be enabled/disabled individually in the mod's configuration).

Teleportation:
- Return Tools: Adds an upgraded Magic Mirror and phones that include the return portal feature of the Potion of Return.
- Teleport Item Scroll-Away: When you teleport using a potion, mirror, or phone, your hotbar will automatically scroll to its first item so you don't accidentally teleport again. (Disabled by default.)

Liquid Manipulation:
- Bottomless Multipurpose Bucket: A Tinkerer's Workshop combination of the Bottomless Buckets for the three mundane liquids, switchable like the Shellphone.
- Endless Sources & Drains: Mechanisms for creating or removing endless amounts of liquid. Crafted with a pump and the corresponding Bottomless Bucket or Sponge.

Wiring:
- Signal Generator: A craftable tool you can use to activate wires by clicking on them.
- Button: A visually stateless alternative to the switch. Sold by the Mechanic.
- Music Box (Silence): Suppresses the game's music. Sold by the Wizard in a graveyard.

Vanilla Item Obtainability:
- Missing Furniture Recipes: Adds missing recipes for Dungeon and Obsidian furniture.
- Lihzahrd Item Renewability: Lihzahrd placeable items can be obtained by shopping from NPCs in the Jungle after defeating Golem.

- Pwnhammer Recipe: The Pwnhammer is craftable from Hallowed Bars.
